Use a basic template to generate random non-sequential codes. New and improved version uses an in-memory SQLite database and it's now a whole lot faster.

As far as the template goes, use `X` to stand in the place of a letter and `0` for a number. 

So if you give a template of `X00` you'll get codes like `H73` or `S32`. 

If you actually want an X or 0 to appear in the code then you're out of luck.
