# Introduction #

Non-sequential, random code generation


# Details #

Use a basic template to generate random non-sequential codes. New and improved version uses an in-memory SQLite database and it's now a whole lot faster.

As far as the template goes, use X to stand in the place of a letter and 0 for a number. So if you give a code of X00 you'll get codes like H73 or S32. If you actually want an X or 0 to appear in the code then you're out of luck. Email me and I'll try sort you out.
